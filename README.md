## 🔍 About the Dataset  
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning containing 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species. Each sample has 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🧠 ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier  

This project:

- Loads the built-in Iris dataset
- Splits the data into training and testing sets (80/20)
- Applies a Random Forest Classifier with:
       - 100 decision trees (estimators)
       - Random state set for reproducibility
- Predicts outcomes on test data
- Evaluates performance using accuracy score
