## 📊 Random Forest Classifier on Iris Dataset  

This project demonstrates the Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn. It applies a supervised machine learning approach to classify the well-known Iris dataset and evaluates the model's accuracy.

## 🔍 About the Dataset  
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning containing 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species. Each sample has 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🧠 ML Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier  
This project:

- Loads the built-in Iris dataset  
- Splits the data into training and testing sets (80/20)  
- Applies a Random Forest Classifier with:  
  - 100 decision trees (estimators)  
  - Random state set for reproducibility  
- Predicts outcomes on test data  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy score
